# Local Area Network Design - University of Moratuwa

## üìã Project Overview

This project presents the comprehensive design of a Local Area Network (LAN) infrastructure for the University of Moratuwa (UoM), including both the university backbone network and the internal network for the Department of Electronic and Telecommunication Engineering (ENTC).

## üéØ Project Objectives

### University Backbone Network
- Design a high-speed, reliable, and secure backbone network connecting multiple university buildings
- Implement redundancy and disaster recovery mechanisms
- Ensure scalability for 20-25 years of operation
- Handle peak traffic loads up to 1.38 Gbps from LEARN connectivity

### ENTC Department Network  
- Create a secure, scalable, and cost-effective internal network
- Support laboratory equipment, workstations, and security devices
- Implement VLAN segmentation for different user groups
- Integrate wireless access points and security systems (CCTV, RFID door locks)

## üèóÔ∏è Network Architecture

### Backbone Network Design
- **Topology:** Ring topology with 9 Layer 3 switch nodes
- **Primary Links:** 10 Gbps single-mode fiber
- **Backup Links:** 1 Gbps multi-mode fiber for disaster recovery
- **Routing Protocol:** OSPF (Open Shortest Path First)
- **Redundancy:** HSRP (Hot Standby Router Protocol) implementation

### ENTC Network Design
- **Topology:** Hierarchical star topology
- **Core Switch:** Cisco Catalyst 3650-24 (Layer 3)
- **Access Switches:** Cisco Catalyst 2960-24TT (Layer 2)
- **Wireless Infrastructure:** Centrally managed access points
- **Security Integration:** Dedicated VLANs for CCTV and RFID systems

## üîß Technical Specifications

### Key Network Components

- **Layer 2 Switches:** Cisco Catalyst 2960-24TT (31 units total)
- **Routers:** Cisco 2811 and ISR4331 models
- **Wireless Controller:** Cisco 2504 WLC
- **Servers:** 3 Enterprise servers for various services

### Network Services
- **DHCP:** Centralized IP address management across all VLANs
- **DNS:** Domain name resolution services
- **FTP:** File transfer services (files.mrt.ac.lk)
- **Email:** Complete email infrastructure
- **RADIUS:** Centralized authentication for wireless access
- **Wireless Management:** Cisco WLC for access point control

### VLAN Configuration
The ENTC network implements 24 VLANs for different purposes:
- **VLANs 10-135:** General user devices (17 VLANs)
- **VLAN 200:** RFID Door Locks (Static IP assignment)
- **VLAN 220:** CCTV Cameras (Static IP assignment)

## üí∞ Cost Analysis

### University Backbone Network
- **Total Hardware Cost:** $82,503.00
- **SFP Modules Cost:** $15,554.00
- **Connection Media Cost:** $2,430.00
- **Grand Total:** $100,487.00

### ENTC Department Network
- **Layer 2 Switches (11x 2960-24TT):** LKR 16,500
- **Layer 3 Switch (1x 3650-24):** LKR 5,000  
- **Access Points (17 units):** LKR 340
- **Total Cost:** LKR 21,840

## üîí Security Features

- **VLAN Segmentation:** Isolated network segments for different user types
- **RADIUS Authentication:** Centralized wireless access control
- **Static IP Assignment:** For critical security devices (cameras, door locks)
- **Access Control:** Managed through Cisco WLC
- **Network Monitoring:** Integrated CCTV system on dedicated VLAN

## üìä Performance Metrics

### Bandwidth Utilization
- **LEARN Connection:** 1.5 Gbps capacity
- **Peak Usage:** 1.38 Gbps (92% utilization)
- **Critical Need:** Efficient inter-VLAN routing to manage internal traffic

### Network Capacity
- **Each VLAN:** Supports up to 251 users
- **DHCP Pools:** Configured for optimal IP address distribution
- **Routing Efficiency:** OSPF metrics ensure optimal path selection

## üõ†Ô∏è Simulation Environment

**Note:** This design was implemented and tested using Cisco Packet Tracer. The hardware models used are older generation devices due to simulator limitations, but the design principles apply to modern equipment.

### Simulation Results
‚úÖ DHCP successfully configured for all VLANs  
‚úÖ Devices receive correct IP addresses and gateways  
‚úÖ Inter-VLAN routing operational  
‚úÖ Successful ping tests between VLANs  
‚úÖ Wireless devices can access internet via access points  
‚úÖ OSPF routing tables populated correctly  
‚úÖ HSRP redundancy functional  

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

- **Hardware Obsolescence:** Simulated devices are end-of-life; production implementation requires current-generation equipment
- **Pricing Disclaimer:** Listed prices are indicative only due to hardware obsolescence
- **Packet Tracer Limitations:** Some advanced features (10G SFP+) cannot be fully simulated



**Disclaimer:** This network design was created for educational purposes as part of the EN2150 course requirements. Implementation in production environments should involve thorough security assessments and updated hardware selections.
